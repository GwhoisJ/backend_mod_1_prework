# Part A
## Reflections on article
  I find that I actually do a lot of this already, in my opinion. The first several points the article makes I found that I already do, but at the end when they talk about taking breaks is where my greatest opportunity for improvement is. I tend to work really hard until the work is done, and I feel this is very inefficient just like the article says. I'm definitely going to try to be better about that in the future.
